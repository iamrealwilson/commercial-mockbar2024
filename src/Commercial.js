DC disputed the claim, saying that he paid all dues as shown by the fact that he was previously elected as Director and President of Medici. Medici, on the other hand, claimed that DC’s obligation was a carry-over of his obligations to the condominium developer, Medici Construction Corporation. Consequently, DC was prevented from exercising his right to vote and be voted for during the 2011 election of Medici’s Board of Directors. This prompted DC to file a complaint for damages before the Special Commercial Court of Pasig City.

Twin Rivers is a non-governmental organization whose supporting papers, after audit, were found by theCommission on Audit to be fictitious. Other than to prepare and submit falsifies papers to support the encashment of the pork barrel checks, Twin Rivers does not appear to have done anything on the endorsed projects and Congressman Abner likewise does not appear to have bothered to monitor the  progress of  the  project he  endorsed. The congressmen converted most of  the commissions he generated into US dollars, and deposited these in a foreign currency account with Banco de Plata (BDP).Based on amply-supported tips given by a congressman from another political party, the Anti- Money Laundering Council sent B DP an order: (1) to confirm Cong. Abner’s deposits with the bank and to provide details of these deposits; and (2) to hold all withdrawals and other transactions involving the congressman’s bank accounts.As counsel for BDP, would you advise the bank to comply with the order?

Thereafter, Company X was notified by the BIR of its non-payment of its unpaid taxes despite the P500,000.00 debit from its account.   This prompted the company to seek assistance from the proper authorities to investigate on the matter.The results of the investigation disclosed that unknown then to Company X, its chief accountant Bonifacio Santos is part of a syndicate that devised a scheme to siphon its funds. It was discovered that though deposited, the check was never paid to the BIR but was passed  on by Santos to Winston Reyes, Banks B’s branch manager and Santos’ co-conspirator.  Instead of bringing the check to the clearing house, Reyes replaced Check No. 12345 with a worthless check bearing thesame amount, and tempered documents to cover his tracks.
